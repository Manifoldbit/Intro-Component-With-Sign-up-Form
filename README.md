## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
function setErrorFor(input, message) {
	const formControl = input.parentElement;
	const small = formControl.querySelector('small');
	formControl.className = 'form-control error';
	small.innerText = message;
}

function setSuccessFor(input) {
	const formControl = input.parentElement;
	formControl.className = 'form-control success';
	alert("Please check your email to claim your free trial");
}

```

### Continued development

I really want to keep developing my skills in HTML, CSS and most expecially JavaScript. This project really took much of my time and i learnt alot about javscript while building this page.
